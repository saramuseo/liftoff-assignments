## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Track My Eats is a way for users to document which restaurants they've eaten at over a selected time period. Similar to Spotify, where users receive summaries of what they listened to, users in Track My Eats can review their year, month, etc. of culinary adventures, which ones would they eat at again, which missed the mark, and how well their tastes compared to Yelpers. Summaries can also be available by location, type of food, rating, experience type. Private and public settings help those who just want their own data to themselves and those who like to share with friends be able to share.

### Features

2) Flexible Summary: A way for users to summarize their eating trips based on a variety of filtering options, including time period.
